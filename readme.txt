Automatically complete your WooCommerce orders based on order type and payment method. Work smarter, not harder!

== Description ==

**Say goodbye to manual order processing!** 👋

Autocomplete Orders for WooCommerce is a smart plugin that automatically changes the status of your WooCommerce orders from "Processing" to "Completed" based on your preferences. No more tedious clicking - let your store run on autopilot!

= 🚀 Features =

* **Multiple Autocomplete Modes**
  * None - Keep things manual (boring, but we won't judge 😉)
  * All Orders - Automatically complete all paid orders (perfect for digital products)
  * Virtual Orders - Automatically complete orders with only virtual products
  * Virtual & Downloadable Orders - Keep the default WooCommerce behavior

* **Gateway-Specific Order Statuses**
  * Customize the default order status for each payment gateway
  * Take control of your order flow for each payment method

* **Payment Verification**
  * Double-check payment status after 1 minute to ensure payment is successful
  * Prevents accidental order completion for failed payments

* **User-Friendly Interface**
  * Beautiful settings page integrated with WooCommerce
  * Clear, helpful descriptions for each option
  * Modern toggle switches and intuitive controls

= ❓ How It Works =

This plugin works with orders that call the `woocommerce_payment_complete()` or `$order->payment_complete()` methods. Most payment gateways like PayPal and credit cards trigger this action automatically.

Since shipping and access to products shouldn't happen until payment is received, orders that haven't been paid won't be automatically completed.

**Note:** The plugin won't automatically complete orders with these payment methods (unless you change their default status in the settings):
* Check Payments (WooCommerce core)
* Direct Bank Transfer / BACS (WooCommerce core)
* Cash on Delivery (WooCommerce core)
* Other gateways that default to "On Hold" or "Pending Payment" instead of "Processing"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work with all payment gateways? =

This plugin works with any payment gateway that properly calls the WooCommerce payment_complete() method. Most popular payment gateways like PayPal, Stripe, and credit card processors do this correctly.

However, some payment methods like Check Payments, Direct Bank Transfer, and Cash on Delivery typically set orders to "On Hold" or "Pending Payment" instead of "Processing". For these methods, you can use our plugin settings to change their default status.

= Will this plugin complete orders that haven't been paid? =

No! This plugin only completes orders after payment has been confirmed. Orders that are in "Pending Payment" or "Failed" status won't be automatically completed.

= Can I still manually complete orders? =

Absolutely! This plugin doesn't prevent you from manually changing order statuses. It simply automates the process based on your preferences.

= Will this plugin work with my custom order statuses? =

Yes, as long as your custom order statuses are properly registered with WooCommerce, our plugin will respect them and work correctly.

= Does this plugin slow down my site? =

Not at all! The plugin is designed to be lightweight and only runs when an order status changes or a payment is completed. It won't affect your site's performance.
